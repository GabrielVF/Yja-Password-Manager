This application **does not collect, store, or share any personal data**.

- All the data you input into the application (such as passwords or any other information) is stored exclusively on your local device.
- We do not use servers, cloud services, or tracking mechanisms. Your information never leaves your device.

The app may request specific permissions to access system features (such as file system access for importing/exporting Vaults), but these are solely used to provide the offered functionalities and never to collect personal data.

## Third Parties
