# Yes, Just Another... Password Manager, but worse. 
> Coming soon! Just adding the final touches to the Version 1 code. üéâ

The title says it all: Yes, just another password manager, but worse. There are plenty of truly fantastic password managers out there. Just to name a few: 1Password, LastPass, NordPass, KeePass, Keeper, Bitwarden, and the list goes on. All of them are undoubtedly better than this one.

Let me walk you through why this is *definitely* a worse password manager:

- **Open Source**: Every single line of code is out in the open for you to scrutinize, test, debug, or even tweak if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous. No backdoors, no hidden surprises. You can even audit the code for bugs, because who doesn‚Äôt love a scavenger hunt?
- **Local Storage Only**: All your data stays snug and cozy on your computer. Not a single byte of information will ever leave your device. (Seriously, this software couldn‚Äôt call home even if it wanted to.)
- **AES256 Encryption**: Passwords are stored in ‚ÄúVaults,‚Äù and each Vault is encrypted with the AES256 algorithm‚Äîbecause "military-grade encryption" just sounds so clich√©.
- **Unlimited Vaults**: You can create as many Vaults as your paranoid heart desires. Each Vault is secured with its own unique combination of a name and password. Yes, you can have multiple Vaults with the same name as long as their passwords are different. Because why not?
- **Portable Vaults**: You can export your Vaults and import them on other devices. Sharing is caring, after all.
- **Minimalist, Non-Invasive Design**: It's so simple it‚Äôs almost suspicious. And if you hate GUIs, good news‚Äîyou can even run it from the command line. Hardcore, right?

Personally, I‚Äôve always believed a good user interface is like a joke‚Äîif you have to explain it, it‚Äôs not that great. So, honestly, I think this software doesn‚Äôt need much more explaining. If you don‚Äôt get it, well‚Ä¶ maybe password managers aren‚Äôt your thing.

## Why Xojo?  

This software is built using **Xojo**. Why? Well, I like Xojo. As a lone, hobbyist developer, it allows me to be more productive. This does come with a catch: you‚Äôll need a compatible Xojo license if you want to compile the code yourself. (Yes, compiling it yourself is absolutely encouraged, but you‚Äôll have to bring your own license to the party.)

## Requirements

- **macOS**: This app is exclusively for macOS. Windows and Linux versions? Maybe someday‚Ä¶ if I get enough funding.
- **Xojo License**: If you want to compile the code yourself, you'll need a compatible Xojo license.
